# machine-learning-notes ðŸ—ˆ
At the beginning of the Spring 2023, I was hired as an Undergraduate research assistant, and decided to use the opportunity to learn the basics of Deep Learning. 

My goal is to explore deep learning concepts in a language that is easy for me to **read** and **understand**. When I encounter difficult mathematical formulas, I will try my best to understand how it was obtained and make sure to detail my process towards understanding. It may be useful to someone else. I use this repo to store my notes and my learning journey.

To make the goal above acheivable, I would like to break it into multiple steps.

The cool/scary thing is at the time I am writing this... I *do not* know all the steps. It's a journey. I will determine the next steps based on what I feel I must focus on, right now.

# Step 1: The Basics ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¨

At this stage of my journey, I want to learn about the following **fundamental neural network architectures**:

1. MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP)
2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
3. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

While learning about those architectures, I want to:

- Learn their use cases
- How to implement them using PyTorch
- Their strengths and weaknesses
- The math behind it?
