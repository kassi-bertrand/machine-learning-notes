# deep-learning-notes ðŸ—ˆ
To prepare for my undergraduate research position, I decided to learn the basics of Deep Learning. 

My goal is to explore deep learning concepts in a language that is easy for me to **read** and **understand**. When I encounter difficult mathematical formulas, I will try my best to understand how it was obtained and make sure to detail my process towards understanding. It may be useful to someone else. I use this repo to store my notes and my learning journey.

If you find some mistakes in my writing, or my understanding, please send me an email (preferred), or make a PR. Your constructive feedback will be greatly appreciated.
