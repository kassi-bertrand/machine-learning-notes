# machine-learning-notes ðŸ—ˆ
At the beginning of the Spring 2023, I was hired as an Undergraduate research assistant, and decided to use the opportunity to learn the basics of Deep Learning. 

My goal is to explore and describe deep learning concepts in a language that is easy for me to **read** and **understand**. When I encounter difficult mathematical formulas, I will try my best to understand how it was obtained and make sure to detail my process towards understanding. It may be useful to someone else. I use this repo to store my notes and my learning journey.

The cool/scary thing is that... I **do not** know all the steps in advance. In other words, I am carving each new steps as I go. It's a journey. I will determine the next steps based on what I feel I must focus on, right now.

So, this repository is me trying to document my learning experiences and journey. I believe it will be useful for me to look back, and be useful to others as well.

Everything I experiment or try will be stored in the form of Jupyter notebooks, or python source files. Those artefacts will then be grouped in folders with meaningful names.

I guarantee that I will document my process by providing context, and just not paste stuff without reason, or assume you know everything beforehand.
