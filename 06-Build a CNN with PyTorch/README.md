In this new folder of the journal, I explore Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.

# What are CNNs? ðŸ’­

Convolutional Neural Networks are a class (i.e. a family) of models inspired by how the visual cortex of the human brain works when recognizing objects. For this reason, CNNs are highly suited for image-related task.

# Goals ðŸŽ¯

# Notebooks ðŸ““

Here are the notebooks I plan on creating in this folder; order matters:

1. `cnn-basics.ipynb`:

2. `mnist-cnn.ipynb`:

3. `smile-cnn.ipynb`:
