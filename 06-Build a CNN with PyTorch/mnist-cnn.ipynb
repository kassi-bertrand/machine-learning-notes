    "Classifying handwritten digits is not new to me at this point ðŸ˜…. In the previous folder, I used PyTorch to implement an MLP to do the very same thing, and acheived 96% accuracy on the testing set, which I think is pretty good! ðŸ¤·\n",

    "So, implementing this is CNN is also a chance for me to compare the performance of two different architectures (CNN and MLP) on the very same task. In `README.md` of this folder, I introduced CNNs as a family of models that are *well-suited for image-related task*. By the end of this notebook, I will see for myself! The score to beat is: 96%\n",
