# Goal ðŸŽ¯

My goal for this folder is to use PyTorch to write a machine learning model I already explored, the MLP. Basically, the first time I write a model using PyTorch.

# Notebooks ðŸ““

Here are notebook(s) I create in this folder. Order matters.

1. `mlp-torch.ipynb`: Where I write an MLP using PyTorch, and train it on the MNIST dataset.
