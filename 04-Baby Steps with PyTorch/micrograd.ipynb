    "# What is Micrograd?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"**Micrograd**\" is small autograd engine. The word **Autograd** is short for \"**Automatic Gradient**\". Autograd is also the name of PyTorch's automatic differentiation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "What \"Micrograd\" does, is that it implements the \"Backpropagation\" algorithm. \"Backprop\" helps us **efficiently compute the gradient of a loss/error function with respect to the weights of a given neural network**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the gradient, we can iterativelly tune/tweak the weights of a network to minimize our loss function."
