    "# What is Micrograd?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"**Micrograd**\" is small autograd engine. The word **Autograd** is short for \"**Automatic Gradient**\". Autograd is also the name of PyTorch's automatic differentiation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "What \"Micrograd\" does, is that it implements the \"Backpropagation\" algorithm. \"Backprop\" helps us **efficiently compute the gradient of a loss/error function with respect to the weights of a given neural network**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the gradient, we can iterativelly tune/tweak the weights of a network to minimize our loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am building Micrograd following **Andrej Karpathy** [YouTube](https://youtu.be/VMj-3S1tku0) video."

    "# Why Am I learning this? ðŸ’¡ðŸ§ \n",
    "\n",
    "1. I want **Deep understanding**. As a newcomer, I do not want to fall into the rush of building the \"cool\" stuff. I would like to practice patience, taking the time to learn... I want to believe that it will pay ten fold in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. According to Andrej, **Backpropagation is at the CORE of any modern deep learning frameworks**, like PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, etc... I believe him.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. My supervisor told me that PyTorch's Autograd is useful when debugging a neural network, and debugging is an important part of neural network development. So, taking some time to understand what happens under the hood might pay in the future? We'll see. I can only connect the dots looking backward. ðŸ˜‰"
