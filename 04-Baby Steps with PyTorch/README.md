# What is PyTorch? ðŸ¤”ðŸ’­

[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a Machine Learning framework. It consists of a set of re-usable tools designed to help us build machine Learning models so we do not start entirely from sratch every time.

In my understanding, PyTorch is:

1. **A toolkit**: PyTorch contains pre-built Machine Learning tools like Deep Learning primitives, Neural Network layer types, various activation functions, optimizers, and pre-trained models and datasets. PyTorch also provides capabilities to leverage the power of NVIDIA GPUs through hardware acceleration and provides libraries for Computer Vision (Torchvision), Natural Language Processing(Torchnlp).

2. **A Prototyping Tool**: PyTorch aims to ease the process of building Machine Learning models, so we can iterate quickly and often. It makes it a great tool for conducting research.

3. **Production Ready**: PyTorch provides tools to deploy Machine Learning models for use at entreprise scale.

4. **Open Source** ðŸ˜ˆ

# Why PyTorch and not Tensorflow?

My supervisor said we are using PyTorch. Simple. ðŸ™‚

# Goal ðŸŽ¯

In this folder, the goal is to familiarize with PyTorch. Below, the notebooks containing my notes as I go. They will be created in the order listed:

1. `tensors.ipynb`: Where I learn to build and manipulate PyTorch tensors.

2. `micrograd.ipynb`: Where I learn to build a small differentiation engine from sratch, thanks to Andrej Kaparthy's [video](https://youtu.be/VMj-3S1tku0) on the subject.
