In my understanding, when people use the word \"tokenizing\", they refer to the process of \"breaking\" raw strings into chunks. Each chunks have a unique identifier. The process of breaking can be done following different strategies or schemas. For instance, google uses [sentence piece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) to encode text into integers. It is sub word tokenizer. It does not encode entire words, and it does not encode down to the characters as well. It is somewhere in the middle... sub words tokenizer.\n",

The following is my attempt at putting my understanding in words. It's not that different from what Andrej expressed, but for some reason... I get it a little better. Maybe because I let my brain 🧠 cook, and it did its thing... I don't know.\n",

When this attention matrix is dotted with the value, it's like we are aggregating values in the value matrix. That's why I kept in my head after hearing Andrej. I came across the Information retrieval analogy when talking about $Q, K, V$ matrices multiple times, but I did not see the link. To me they were just matrices of numbers, so why naming them like this?\n",

In the context of sequence modeling it represents the kind of token, the current one is looking for or wants to attend. The collection of \"Query\" vectors is stored in the \"Queries\" matrix or $Q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each token in the input sequence also generates a \"*Key*\" vector, which represents a token's identifier against which the queries will be matched. Those vectors are, in a way, how a token a \"chooses\" to advertise itself to others in tokens in the sequence. They contain information that helps the model understand the relationship between different tokens in the sequence. The collection of \"Key\" vectors is store in the \"Keys\" matrix or $K$.\n",

    "> **Keys and queries are multiplied together to compute the attention scores**, indicating how much focus or importance should be placed on different parts of the input sequence. Another way to put this is through this process, the query vector of a given token is dotted with the keys of all other tokens in the same sentence (self-attention). If the dot product between a query and a key is high, then it means that the token will \"attend\" (or \"pay attention\") to the other token... There is affinity between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each token also emits a \"*Value*\" vector, which this time, is a representation of itself. \"Value\" vectors represent actual information or content associated with each token in the sequence. This is information is private to each attention heads. In the context of masked self-attention, token are allowed to look at (i.e. attend) past tokens. So, when the matrix containing attention scores is multiplied with the \"Value\" vectors of a sequence of tokens, remember that a weighted sum is happening, meaning \"Value\" vectors of previous tokens are aggregated in the current token's \"Value\" vector. The attention scores determine **how much of each \"value\" vector to aggregate** in the current token.\n",

    "Through forward & backward passes those tokens \"learn\" to emit better queries and keys vectors resulting in better attention scores. What I mean is that to emit those vectors, a token vector goes through a fully connected network (i.e. MLP). If the representation happens to be bad, which will likely be the case early during training, it will impact the network's overall performance. When the network updates its weights through backpropagation, the weights of those MLPs are also updated, resulting in MLPs able to produce better and better \"queries\", \"keys\", and \"values\" vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to put this is that through those forward & backward passes, tokens not only learn what to « look for » (queries), but also what to « present » to other tokens (keys). The result is that during training a token might attend another one. But after few epochs later, the same token may start attending another token… why? Because the network updated itself in a way that results in a smaller loss, so better predictions."
