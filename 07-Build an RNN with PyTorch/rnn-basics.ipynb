    "Sequence data, also known as **sequences**, have a unique characteristic compared to other types of data: *Order matters*. Sequence data, as the name suggests, appear in a certain order and individual data points are **not** independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is unlike what I have seen so far. In what I am used to, training examples are independent from one another. I learned that this type of data is called: **independent and identically distributed(IID)** data. Due to the independence of the data, it does not matter how training samples are fed into the neural network. \n",

    "**Time Series data** is *a special type* of sequential data. Each data point is associated with time. In other words, samples are captured at **successive timestamps**. Stock prices and voice records for instance, are time series data.\n",
