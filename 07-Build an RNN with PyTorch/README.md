In this new folder of the journal, I explore Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their application for sequence modeling.

# What are RNNs?

Recurrent Neural Networks are a class (i.e. a family) of models designed to process sequential data.

# Goals

For this folder, my goals are the following:

- Understand what sequential data is

- How RNNs are able to model sequences?

- What Long short-term memory (LSTM) is?

- What truncated backpropagation through time time?

- Implement an RNN for sentiment analysis

- Implemenet an RNN for character-level modeling with LSTM cells

- Learn to use gradient clipping to avoid exploding gradients.

# Notebooks

Here are the notebook I plan on creating in this folder; order matters:

1. `rnn-basics.ipynb`

- `rnn-sentiment-analysis.ipynb`:

- `rnn-char-lvl-model.ipynb`:
