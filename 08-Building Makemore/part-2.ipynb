    "This notebook is the second in the Makemore series. In part 1 we implemented Makemore using a bigram model. We looked at ONE previous character and produced a probability distribution of what character is likely to come next. We did that using two different approaches and reached the same results. First, we used counts and normalized them into probabilities. Second, we used a simple neural network (i.e. linear layer) to produce those same probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The limit of our implementation in part 1 is that it only looks at ONE previous character; and because the bigram model took only ONE character as context, the prediction of the bigram were **not** good. If we were to use consider MORE than one character when predicting the next one, the approach we used in part-1 (storing everything in a tensor) becomes unsustainable because _the number of combinations we will have to store in a tensor grows exponentially with the amount characters we take as context_. For instance, if we were to take just three characters as context when making a prediction, we would have to store $27 \\times 27 \\times 27 = 19683$ possibilities in a tensor. That's way to many possibilities, the majority of these possibilities will have very few counts, Andrej said.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why for this second part, we are moving away from the Bigram model. This time, we are implementing a Multi-Layer Percepton to predict the next character. The modeling approach we are going to adopt follows the paper: [Bengio et al. 2003](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf) "

    "This paper, Andrej said, is not the first to have proposed the use of MLPs to predict the next character/token in a sequence, but was very influencial and is very often cited. Since the paper is long ($19$ pages) Andrej decided to give us gist of it, but invited us to read the entire work. This paper is what we are going to implement in this notebook."
