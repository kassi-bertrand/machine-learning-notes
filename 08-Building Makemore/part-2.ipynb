    "# Introduction\n",

    "This notebook is the second in the Makemore series. In part 1 we implemented Makemore using a bigram model. We looked at ONE previous character and produced a probability distribution of what character is likely to come next. We did that using two different approaches and reached the same results. First, we used counts and normalized them into probabilities. Second, we used a simple neural network (i.e. linear layer) to produce those same probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The limit of our implementation in part 1 is that it only looks at ONE previous character; and because the bigram model took only ONE character as context, the prediction of the bigram were **not** good. If we were to use consider MORE than one character when predicting the next one, the approach we used in part-1 (storing everything in a tensor) becomes unsustainable because _the number of combinations we will have to store in a tensor grows exponentially with the amount characters we take as context_. For instance, if we were to take just three characters as context when making a prediction, we would have to store $27 \\times 27 \\times 27 = 19683$ possibilities in a tensor. That's way to many possibilities, the majority of these possibilities will have very few counts, Andrej said.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's why for this second part, we are moving away from the Bigram model. This time, we are implementing a Multi-Layer Percepton to predict the next character. The modeling approach we are going to adopt follows the paper: [Bengio et al. 2003](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf) "

    "Call `view` function manipulates the attributes of the tensor that dictates how this 1-D sequence is interpreted (i.e. \"viewed\") as a tensor. The efficiency of `view` comes from the fact that _no memory is created, or copied_. It's just some of the internal attributes of tensor, namely the storage offset, the stride, and shape so that this 1-D sequence of bytes is \"view\" or \"seen\" as different n-dimensional array. Andrej recommended this [blog post, from Eric](http://blog.ezyang.com/2019/05/pytorch-internals/) to in further details and understanding how tensors are represented. He also said that he might create an entire video of this topic (torch internals) as well. But as of now, we keep in mind that the `view` function is an efficient function.\n",

Using the `view` function, we can ask Pytorch to \"view\" our `embed` matrix, as a $32 \\times 6$ instead. We can verify the following result by doing an element-wise equal check with of one of the previous results we got."
