# Coding Attention Mechanisms

This folder contains materials related to the implementation and explanation of attention mechanisms, particularly in the context of machine learning models like Transformers. The content is structured as both theory and hands-on code, providing a comprehensive understanding of self-attention and multi-head attention.

## Contents

- **`README.md`**: This file provides an overview of the folder structure and its contents.
- **`chp3-coding-attn.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook that includes:
  - Theoretical explanations of attention mechanisms.
  - Step-by-step implementations of single-head and multi-head self-attention using PyTorch.
  - Practical examples and code snippets demonstrating key concepts like masked attention and causal masking.

## Highlights from the Notebook

### Key Topics

1. **Self-Attention**:
   - Explanation of attention scores, weights, and context vectors.
   - PyTorch implementation of basic self-attention.

2. **Masked and Causal Attention**:
   - Introduction to masking techniques for sequence processing.
   - Code examples showing how to apply masks in attention computations.

3. **Multi-Head Attention**:
   - Theoretical benefits of multi-head attention for richer representation.
   - Implementation of multi-head attention using PyTorch.

4. **Practical Considerations**:
   - Efficient tensor operations.
   - Handling batch processing and sequence lengths.

### Code Examples

- Core PyTorch modules for attention, including `SelfAttention` and `MultiHeadCausalSelfAttention` classes.

## How to Use

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x
   - PyTorch (tested with version >=1.10)
   - Jupyter Notebook (optional for interactive exploration)

2. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Open `chp3-coding-attn.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   - Execute cells sequentially to explore both theoretical and practical aspects of attention mechanisms.
