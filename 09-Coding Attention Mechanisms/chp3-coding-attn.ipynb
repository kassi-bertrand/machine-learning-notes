    "This section aims to introduce us to the topic and its motivation. Let's go step by step through an example. Let's consider the following sentence:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Your journey starts with one step.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Each element $i$ of this sequence (i.e. token) has an associate *token embedding* $x^{(i)}$ which is a $d$-dimensional vector representing the $i^{th}$ element of the input sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, $x^{(1)}$ corresponds to a $d$-dimensional vector representing the token \"Your\" in the our example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In self-attention, our goal is **calculate a \"context vector\" $z^{(i)}$ for EACH element $x^{(i)}$ in the input sequence**. A \"context vector\" can be interpreted as some form of enriched embedding vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "> What is the difference between a \"token embedding\" and a \"context vector\"? I mean... why do we need to \"enrich\" an already existing embedding vector? 🤷\n",
    "\n",
    "It's to allow elements in the input sequence to adjust their representation (i.e. embedding vector, i.e. behavior in the embedding space) based on the absence/presence of other elements in the same sequence (self-attention) or another sequence (cross-attention). That way, their representation better aligns with the *context* the element finds itself in. Do you follow?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me give you a tangible example. When I was kid, I had a way of behaving when my parents, especially my dad, left home for work. But when he comes back, his presence causes me to adjust my behavior accordingly. If my dad and I were two vectors, I would be updating my internal representation (i.e. my embedding vector) based on the presence/absence of my dad's embedding vector. We say that I (meaning my vector) would be \"attending\" to my dad's. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another example can I think of. When I am with the boys, I can be goofier, than when I am with the lady I am in love with. Here again, my behavior changes slightly depending on the \"*context*\" I find myself in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same idea applies to elements in our original input sequence. They adjust (or should I say enrich) their representation (i.e. embedding vector) based on the presence/absence of other tokens to better capture the \"meaning\" of the sequence they're in. If i am the word \"fire 🔥\", and I find myself the following two sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  \"This is a fire\"\n",
    "-  \"This is fire\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I, the word fire 🔥, mean two different things. I am expressing two different ideas in those sentences. So, I need to adjust my embedding to reflect that. How? by scouring my surrounding, which in this case, is the sentence I am in. After my update my representation better reflects the context I am in. This new representation is what I called my \"**context vector**\".\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hum... okay, okay... but how do they \"adjust\" their representation? Like how does it happen exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's through the attention mechanism that, input sequence elements, form their corresponding context vectors. In the case of self-attention, each element in the input sequence incorporate information from ALL other element in the same sequence. When it's cross-attention, element in the input sequence incorporate information from all other elements in *another* sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this concept, let’s focus on the embedding vector of the second input element, $x^{(2)}$ (which corresponds to the token “journey”) and the corresponding context vector, $z^{(2)}$. This enhanced context vector,$z^{(2)}$, is an embedding that contains information about $x^{(2)}$ and all other input elements, $x^{(1)}$ to $x^{(T)}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Computing x(2) context vector](imgs/3/0.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, notice the weight values on the edges. These weights, which we call attention scores, indicate how much information each token should incorporate from its surrounding tokens. For example, a higher attention score between \"journey\" and another word means \"journey\" will incorporate more information from that word into its context vector. \n",

    "The first step of implementing self-attention is to **compute the \"attention scores\" $w$**. These are intermediate values obtained by **computing the dot product between $x^{(2)}$ and all other elements of the input sequence $x^{(1)}$ to $x^{(T)}$**. By the way, while we're using $x^{(2)}$ as our running example here, keep in mind that this same process happens for every single token in our input sequence - each token gets its chance to be the star of the show and query all other tokens!\n",

It's \"querying\" the input sequence in a sense. The other vectors we are dotting $x^{(2)}$'s representation with (marked as \"inputs\" on the image) are called: \"keys\". A \"key\", in this context, refers a numerical representation that each element of the input sequence \"exposes\" for the query vector to extract information from. A \"key\" is information the element of the input sequence exposes about itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick note: In this simple version of self-attention, we're actually using the *same* vector to serve as \"query\", \"key\", and \"value\" (I talk about \"value\" a little down there) for each token. So $x^{(2)}$ is playing all these roles! In later sections, we'll see how we can create separate vectors for each of these roles, which gives our attention mechanism more flexibility and power."

It's like at this stage the \"query\" vector is saying: \"Now, that I know how much each input is relevant to me (attention scores), to enhance my representation and get a context-aware representation, I want $0.2$% of the value vector of the first input element, then $0.6$% of the value vector of the second input element, etc.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "**Causal attention**, also known as *masked attention*, is a specialized form of self-attention. It restricts a model to only consider previous and current inputs in a sequence when processing any given token when computing attention scores. This is in contrast to the standard self-attention mechanism, which allows access to the entire input sequence at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "When training a model to autoregressively predict the next word, we want the model to only use previous words to \"guess\" the next word. In other words, we allow words in the input sequence to \"attend\" to **previous words ONLY**, so only the last word in the sequence gets to \"see\" the entire sequence. Causal attention is crucial for developing a language model.\n",

To compensate for the reduction in active elements, the values of the remaining elements in the matrix are scaled up by a factor of $\\frac{1}{1 - \\text{dropout rate}}$. In our case, it's $\\frac{1}{1 - 0.5} = 2$. All of the zeroing out and the scaling stuff is done internally by the `torch.nn.Dropout` layer."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Earlier, I we briefly defined multi-head attention. Multi-head attention extends the single-head mechanism by performing attention computations multiple times in parallel. Each of these \"heads\" independently focuses on a different aspect of the input data, which significantly improves the model's capacity to understand complex relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hum... okay, okay... but how does it work? How is it different from single head attention?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's recall that multi-head attention is an extension of single head attention. Here is how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multiple Heads:**\n",
    "   - Instead of a single set of projections for queries, keys, and values, multi-head attention uses multiple independent sets of parameters, one for each \"head.\" These projections transform the input sequence into different subspaces, enabling each head to focus on different patterns or relationships.\n",
    "   - For example:\n",
    "     - One head might attend to long-range dependencies in the sequence.\n",
    "     - Another might focus on local relationships (e.g., adjacent tokens).\n",
    "     - Yet another could specialize in recognizing specific semantic roles (e.g., subject-object relationships in sentences).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independent Attention Computations:**\n",
    "   - Each head computes its attention scores and context vectors independently, just like single-head attention does. The result is a set of context vectors, one for each head, where each captures a different \"perspective\" on the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Concatenation and Final Projection:**\n",
    "   - The context vectors from all heads are concatenated along the feature dimension, producing a combined representation of the sequence.\n",
    "   - This concatenated output is then passed through a final linear layer, which projects it back into the original embedding space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> But why use multi-head attention?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-head attention addresses the limitations of single-head attention by allowing the model to learn and combine diverse relationships simultaneously. Let’s consider an example to illustrate this:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example Sentence:** *\"The cat sat on the mat.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sentence:\n",
    "- One head might focus on the relationship between \"cat\" and \"sat\" (subject-action).\n",
    "- Another head might look at \"sat\" and \"mat\" (action-location).\n",
    "- A third head might capture the broader syntactic structure, such as identifying \"The cat\" as a noun phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these diverse perspectives, multi-head attention creates a richer representation of the sequence, enabling the model to understand it more deeply. Imagine single-head attention as a single spotlight scanning a scene. It can only focus on one thing at a time. In contrast, multi-head attention is like having multiple spotlights, each illuminating a different part of the scene. Together, they provide a more complete understanding.\n",

    "## Few explanations about the `MultiHeadCausalSelfAttention` module\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What does `self.W_qkv` represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "This linear layer produces a vector three times the dimension of its input. Another way of looking at this larger vector is as 3 concatenated vectors of the *same* size. Effectively getting the three projections for each of our tokens in one go, using one matrix, instead of three different ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "```txt\n",
    "Input: [____] (dimension C)\n",
    "Output: [____|____|____] (dimension 3C = Q|K|V)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why did we do `q, k, v = torch.split(qkv_proj, dim=2)`?\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, we used a single linear layer to obtain the three projections of each token in each input sequence. And those projections are concatenated along `dim=2`, the 3rd dimension of our tensor. So `torch.split`, as its name suggests, splits (along the 3rd dimension) our `qkv_proj` matrix of shape `(B, T, C*3)` into three separate matrices `q`, `k`, and `v`... each of shape `(B, T, C)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Can you tell me about the reshape using `view(B, T, self.n_head, C // self.n_head)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, we are trying to perform attention in parallel, that is in different \"heads\". We know that C (embedding dimension) must be divisible by number of heads (that's why there's the assert statement in `__init__` method).\n",
    "\n",
    "So if C = 768 and n_head = 12, each head will get 768/12 = 64 dimensions\n",
    "The view operation splits the last dimension (C) into two dimensions: (n_head, C//n_head)\n",
    "This preserves the total number of elements: B * T * C = B * T * n_head * (C//n_head)\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting `q`, `k`, and `v` matrices are of this shape: $(B \\times T \\times \\text{nh} \\times \\text{ns})$ where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `B`   = Batch size\n",
    "- `T`   = Sequence length\n",
    "- `nh`  = Number of heads\n",
    "- `hs`  = Head size (the embedding dimension inside each head)\n",
    "\n",
    "The question you might be asking yourself now is how **to interpret this 4D tensor**?. Unfortunately, I do not have a nice picture draw to help you visualize, but would like to share my intuition. Personally, I think of 4D tensors as a *list of of 3D tensors*. In our context, the tensor of the `(B, T, nh, hs)` is a list of `B` elements where each element is a 3D tensor of shape `(T, nh, hs)`. So in the case of the `q` matrix, this 4D tensor tells me that each batch element (i.e, input sequence), has `T` elements (tokens) and that each token in the sequence has `nh` vectors of `hs` dimensions. It tells me that the `q` matrix hosts the \"query\" projection that, EACH token in the input sequence, has in EACH head. The same reasoning applies to `k` and `v` matrices, but they hold the \"key\" and \"value\" projections respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why did we do `transpose(1,2)`?\n",
    "\n",
    "- First let talk about the new tensor shape `(B, nh, T, hs)` and what is means. It's still a 4D tensor, but this time the `nh` dimension comes first. This tensor shape tells us that are grouping the projections *by* \"head\", and not by \"sequence\" like before. Essentially, when we \"open\" a 3D tensor we will see that it has `nh` \"heads\" and in a given head, there are the `T`, `hs`-dimensional representation of the token in the sequence. So, we grouping the \"query\", \"key\", and \"value\" representation in the batch *per* head. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Now let's talk about **why** the transpose was necessary. I would like us to remember we are trying to compute attention in each \"head\" *independently* and at the *same time*. It just so happens that when the tensor dimension is like this `(B, T, nh, hs)`, it's less convenient for attention to be computed in parallel. **Without** the transpose, we have this shape `(B, T, nh, hs)`. To compute attention for each head independently, the framework would need to: (1) First iterate through the batch dimension (2) Then through the sequence dimension `T` (3) Only then reach the head dimension to parallelize. **With** the transpose, `nh` is positioned as the batch dimension in each 3D tensor, so we are ready start the computation earlier, than without the transpose. Consider the following snippet for illustration: \n",
    "  ```py\n",
    "    # Without transpose: (B, T, n_head, head_size)\n",
    "    for b in range(batch_size):\n",
    "        for t in range(seq_length):\n",
    "            for h in range(n_heads):  # <- Parallelization happens here (deep in the loops)\n",
    "                compute_attention()\n",
    "\n",
    "    # With transpose: (B, n_head, T, head_size)\n",
    "    for b in range(batch_size):\n",
    "        for h in range(n_heads):  # <- Parallelization happens earlier\n",
    "            compute_attention()\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Also, torch expects batch dimensions to be first, when it's the case it performs operations more efficiently on inner dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why did we need an \"output\" projection?\n",
    "\n",
    "The output projection serves several important purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dimension Reunification**: Remember that we split our embedding dimension (`C`) across multiple heads, where each head worked with a smaller dimension (`C//n_head`). After the attention computation, we need to combine these separate head outputs back into our original embedding dimension size. The output projection helps transform this concatenated multi-head output back into the expected embedding dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Learned Integration**: The output projection learns how to best combine the information from different attention heads. Think of each attention head as looking at different aspects of the relationships between tokens (like how some heads might focus on nearby words while others look at broader context). The output projection learns how to weigh and mix these different types of attention patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Maintaining Network Depth**: Without this projection, we would be directly using the raw attention outputs. The additional linear transformation adds another layer of learned parameters, allowing the network to perform more complex transformations on the attention outputs before passing them to the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: The output projection gets better at doing the above ☝️ *during* training.\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize this:\n",
    "- **Before** output projection: Each token has `n_head` different representations of size `head_size`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **After** output projection: Each token has a single, unified representation of size embed_dim\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the output projection takes input of shape `(B, T, C)` and produces output of the same shape - it's consolidating the multi-head attention information while preserving the original dimensionality of our token embeddings."
