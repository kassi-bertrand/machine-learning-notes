In this new folder of the journal, I explore **M**ulti**L**ayer **P**erceptron (MLP).

# What are MLPs? ðŸ’­

An MLP is a type of *fully connected* Neural Network (NN).

# Goal ðŸŽ¯ 

- Implement and train a vectorized MLP from sratch for image classification.

- Implement vectorized backpropagation algorithm for NN training from sratch.

# Notebooks ðŸ““

This folder contains only one notebook:

1. `mlp.ipynb`: Where I implement a vectorized MLP
